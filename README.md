Python code to reproduce the figures from Braam et al. (2023). Names of notebooks correspond to figure numbers in the paper. 
I am happy to share the data needed to produce the plots. This is not included here due to the size of the files, but just send me a message if you would like the files! (mailto:mbraam@ed.ac.uk) 
The PSG templates 'pcb_psg_emission_temp.txt' and 'pcb_psg_transmission_temp.txt' are used to create synthetic observables such as those in Figure 12 through PSG's API.
